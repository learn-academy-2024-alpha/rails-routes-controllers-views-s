# Rails Controllers, Routes, Views

- MVC pattern
- Model - business logic, data
- Views - UI, what the user sees
- Controller - how the data gets to the view and what view is renders
- Controller works very closely with the routes file
- Routes are associated with requests, define http verb and location
- `rails g controller Home`
- erb - embedded Ruby
- routes - `config/routes.rb`
- controller methods must be named the same as the view file
- view files are created manually
- `<%= %>` erb tags that allow us to embed Ruby code in html
